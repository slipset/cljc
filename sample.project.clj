; This sample project.clj file is suitable as a starting point for building
; libraries using cljx.  Some things it does:
;
; * Clojure and ClojureScript resources generated by cljx are put under
; `target/*`; this means they'll be removed by `lein clean`.
; * Non-test resources are put into `target/classes`; by default, that
; directory's contents will be included in the .jar file produced by Leiningen
; * Generated Clojure testing resources are dropped into `target/test-classes`,
; where `lein test` will pick them up.
; * `.cljx` files are excluded from any generated jar files
; * ClojureScript is a dependency in the `:dev` profile, so it will not be
; transitively passed on to this project's dependents.
;
; Using cljx in an "application" setting (where you're producing artifacts for
; deployment, as opposed to for consumption by other Clojure/ClojureScript
; projects) would use largely the same cljx configuration, though likely a
; different lein-cljsbuild configuration (so that the generated JavaScript is
; placed appropriately for inclusion in .war, ubarjar, or other resource bundles
; destined for deployment).
